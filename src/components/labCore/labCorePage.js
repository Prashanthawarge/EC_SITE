                Many testing labs are frequently represented by dealers who have
                their own client lists and service requirements. Associates is a
                comprehensive contact management system that allows you and your
                dealers to maintain information about clients and their farms,
                fields, and facilities in a secure manner. You can record
                geospatial information about the location of fields as well as
                display test results and recommendations on a regular grid or
                across different management zones. Integration with Google Maps
                also allows your sampling crew to get exact directions and
                enables your clients to view operations on their fields or
                facilities in real time.<br></br> <br></br>Your agri products
                and services can be registered in LabCore along with
                dealer-specific discount codes, product-specific laboratory
                protocols, and the analytical parameters. You can offer these
                products individually or as packages with special pricing. Also,
                your products can be priced per test, or services can be priced
                per facility or by the acre.

                The GIS Visualization module allows the grower to upload

                allows agronomists and their clients to integrate several years
                of yield and soil test data to identify different management
                zones within a field. We use advanced image analysis and machine

                would benefit from profit-boosting investments in drainage,
                conservation tillage, or cover crops.

                The cost of IoT features in your app varies largely depending
                upon factors including but not limited to design & features, app
                size & complexity, hardware, app infrastructure, testing,
                maintenance, the team involved (man hours required for
                development). Taking all these into account, the standard
                pricing of an IoT app can be estimated as follows:

                How much time does it take to develop an app?
              </h2>
              <p className="questonPara">
                It can take upto 3 to 4 months to develop an app to a point
                where it’s ready to be released in public. However, this time
                excludes the time required for ideation, product definition &
                design stages. In case of medium-sized or complex apps, it can
                take much longer.

              <p className="questonPara">
                Some of the key advantages of hiring an app agency are:
              </p>

              <ul className="questonPara" style={{ listStyle: 'disc' }}>
                <li>
                  Clear-cut milestones: Dedicated app agencies with good
                  references & experience lay out well-defined milestones for
                  the app development process and stick to them. You will know
                  exactly how much time it takes and what to expect when.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Time to market: A dedicated agency is far more likely to
                  complete your app ahead of the estimated time, as it has a
                  wide variety of services and resources available at the click
                  of a button to finish your job.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A variety of resources: App development agencies have a wide
                  variety of resources or experts at their disposal. These
                  include designers, programmers, developers, content creators &
                  the like. This helps save a lot of time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Security: Experienced app development agencies give topmost
                  importance to the security of their clients’ data. They
                  maintain utmost care even while sharing information within
                  their team. To safeguard yourself further, you can incorporate
                  a data security clause that covers your project idea, source
                  code & all of your data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Budget sensitivity: Since agencies have experience from
                  working with a variety of clients from across the globe, they
                  can clearly estimate the number of hours that will be required
                  to develop a certain website or app and adjust the billing as
                  per the client’s budget.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Support & maintenance: Dedicated app development agencies can
                  also offer you maintenance & support services once app
                  development is complete, without you having to hire a person
                  or team for the same.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Concentrate on your core business: Outsourcing your app
                  development work to an agency that specializes in the same
                  gives you time & bandwidth to concentrate on your core
                  business/area of expertise to make your product/service
                  better. After all, your customers buy from you more because
                  they’re happy with your product or service, and less because
                  of how impressive your app is.

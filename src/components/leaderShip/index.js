          <p className="leaderParaText">
            Most businesses have to deal with a large amount of data on a daily
            basis. Hence, it is important for them to use software to manage all
            aspects of their business.
          </p>
          <p className="leaderParaText">
            The purpose of a good software solution is to provide painless data
            acquisition and generate insightful reports quickly. The end result
            of the implementation of an appropriate software solution should be
            the accomplishment of tasks by users within a much lesser time
            frame, thu saving massive amounts of time.
          </p>
          <p className="leaderParaText">
            In most cases, companies opt for off-the-shelf software solutions.
            As these solutions lack customization, users are forced to change
            their business processes to suit them. Sometimes this results in
            users being stuck in what we call a "Software Jailhouse."
          </p>
          <p className="leaderParaText">
            On the other hand, when we deploy a customized software solution for
            your business, we make the extra effort to understand the nature of
            your business and emphasize on customizing roles, workflows,
            processes, and reports for you.
